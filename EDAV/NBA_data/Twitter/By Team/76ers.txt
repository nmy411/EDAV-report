Joel Embiid returned for the 76ers and had a great playoff debut with 23 points, seven rebounds, and three blocks. Ben Simmons also flirted with a triple-double for the third straight game. Both of these guys are exceptional and will be perennial All-Stars.

Part 2. Of the game. Which is why the NBA is trying to prevent it from happening and why they fined Cuban for his comments. My argument is the Pacers are not in that worse of position from 76ers and they have always tried to win instead of trying to lose.
