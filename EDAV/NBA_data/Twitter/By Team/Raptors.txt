I don\u2019t know how, but the Wizards need to get from under the Gortat and\/or Mahnimi contract. Keep the core around though. Hard to build like the Raptors, when most of their bench came from the draft, but they need to find good bench players.

I expect the Wizards to come out strong - especially with home crowd behind them. I hope the Raptors are prepared. It would be bad to come back with the series tied 2-2.
