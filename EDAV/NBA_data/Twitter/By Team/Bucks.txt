The Bucks had a tremendously successful small-ball lineup in game 1. I'd give that a go.\n\nAlso, Giannis should be playing 40+ minutes. For the fewer than 8 minutes he'll be sitting, I'd be fine with playing Muhammad at the 4.

I've got a feeling that if the Bucks follow these three black eyed keys then tonight's gonna be a good night.\n1. Win the T.O. margin (transition defense if you do)\n2. Get to the FT line AND make them when you do (7-17, 41% in GM 2)\n3. ENERGY ON BOTH ENDS\nP.S. sorry for my puns.

I look forward to the eventual face-turn for Jabari as he carries the Bucks through a pivotal Game 7, opens up to the locker room, buries any real or perceived hatchets, and signs a reasonable contract to return to Milwaukee.\n\nThe show writing this season has been so predictable.

Insanity is doing something over and over and not expecting the same result. The Bucks don\u2019t have a \u201cwinning\u201d combination and the only player they aren\u2019t giving a chance is a 6\u20198\u201d PF that scored 20 a game last year. THAT\u2019S insanity.

That's an interesting thought, I think yes. Middleton fits in with Portland nicely, likely see Napier slide into a starting role while Middleton plays the 3. While as McCollum offensively is a very lethal shooter, a solid playmaker, would help space the floor, Bucks lose defense.

Keep it fun, but stay focused, ball control is the key. The team had 7 turnovers in game 2, I can't expect your team to do that again, but I think no more than 12 will win it. If the Celtics control the ball, it takes the Bucks crowd out of the game. Will be fun to watch tonight.

It's the lineup that brought the Bucks back in the 4Q of G1. It's also the lineup that used a very successful play repeatedly offensively. Encouraging signs aplenty.\n\nIf the Bucks are not down by a significant amount of points, Stevens would not go big against that lineup.

I still believe he's got alot to give. The Bucks haven't had any proper direction all year long. Add a guy who hasn't played in a year to that mix how do you think that's gonna work? He's 22. He's got ample time to still be very good. It may not be with us but he'll be fine.

What kind of money. No one has any idea how much money he will command. Think of it this way. We are the 3rd worst team in the league, and 1 of 5 that has cap space. If we aren't falling over ourselves to sign him how much do you think he's going to get. Bucks aren't paying him

Sure. The Bucks have also been terrible offensively with Parker On this season.
Fri Apr 20 16:38:28 +0000 201
Bucks maybe giving up on Parker. Or less playing time to keep his price low. But getting him toxic as well. So S&amp;T or let him walk. QO is a no trade clause so stuck with him so I wouldn't bother with a QO.

Fri Apr 20 16:38:35 +0000 201
None of those guys are leaving their homes, with the exception maybe being Randle. Parker falling out with the Bucks makes him actually attainable. My first option is still Nurk, who I also think will be available.

My tweet were for the \"trade Wall &amp; Beal\" crowd. Said exactly what I meant by my definition of what a rebuild is. Take the Hawks for example. They lost Horford, traded away Milsap. That's a rebuild. Bucks fired GM and HC Kidd, traded for Bledsoe, that's not a rebuild.

The Bucks Center position as a whole is really bad. I think most Bucks fans would rather see Thon out there than Henson. Last year against the Raptors Thon Started 6 games and played over 100 minutes compared to 12 minutes from Henson in the series.

I\u2019m sure you\u2019re well aware that the Bucks defense hasn\u2019t been good all season, with or without Jabari. Not sure what personal vendetta you have against him...you single him out and he\u2019s only playing 10 minutes per game yet the Bucks are down 0-2
Fri Apr 20 18:27:54 +0000 201
even now, I think the Bucks are clearly the better team in this series. They are 5.5\/5-point favorites tonight. The Celtics are 7-6 all-time at Milwaukee in the postseason.

I'm sure most people don't see this as a big deal -- and I know some see it as a positive -- but I don't see how the Bucks have a chance without Henson. Giannis at center is fun in theory... but GL against Brad Stevens. They should not be five point favorites.

The frightening thing is the could easily run the table and win in 6 (shout out to ). They can seize control like Toronto did last year when they moved Powell into the starting lineup and the Bucks never adjusted and never recovered. Parker starting? Hmmm...

The problem with center Giannis lineups is that the bucks don\u2019t change their style when they go to it. So they continue to get destroyed. In my opinion. I\u2019m not a Henson hater tho. Bucks starting 5 usually performs well together.

3\/ Bucks County and Philadelphia are neck and neck for worst air pollution levels in PA. But show Bucks actually had more bad air days than Philadelphia last year: 12 \"orange\" days exceeding 70 pbb, and 8 \"red\" days exceeding 75 ppb https:\/\/t.co\/EpHVWNNEyp

4\/ The Bucks County air monitor is in Bristol Township near I-95. I did a 4-part series last year analyzing the sources of Lower Bucks' air pollution. Some blows in from out of the area, but the rest can be attributed to area highways and industrial areas: https:\/\/t.co\/G5zD0d4Cmv
Fri Apr 20 19:59:29 +0000 201
5\/ A big problem is who is breathing all this air in. For one, people living in these Lower Bucks communities are, on average, less affluent and less white than more affluent areas in central and upper Bucks. This is a case of environmental injustice: https:\/\/t.co\/A3pw4H8MIP
Fri Apr 20 19:59:29 +0000 201

That's because D'antoni is a good coach and can establish a system meanwhile Ty Lue will probably get fired at some point \n\nLook at the Celtics without Kyrie and Hayward, that roster shouldn't be up 2-0 against the Bucks. Coaching matters a lot and D'antoni is top class

If I am a Bucks fan Id focus on this. Giannis liteally had the best response you could to what Parker said.\n\nYou need to fire your joke of a GM &amp; obviously not hire Prunty. The roster is probably there with the right leader\/system (Bud-Messina-Hammon-Stack) to give it 1 more go

Should of traded him at the trade deadline. Cause a S&amp;T means Parker can only be traded solo in a trade. Other wise if ya want more Bucks headed it has to be a few side trades then. Heck Parker and bad contract Henson for rental Jordan sounds like gravy now.
