The Pelicans have played well this series, but I still think the Blazers would probably be up 2 games to 1 if they played well too. I still believe this is more of a Blazer problem than a Pelican problem.

Yea teams don\u2019t double and triple team you if they don\u2019t think you\u2019re a superstar.

Pelicans are the worst possible match up draw for the blazers. POR entire offense is ran through PNR. NOP has two of the best PNR defenders in the league. Combine that with a poor shooting slump and that\u2019s why you get 3 beatdowns

Yup. I just don\u2019t think the Blazers are this bad ordinarily. I know the Pelicans are a bad matchup but you would expect that this team is good enough to get at least one or two wins. They\u2019re getting beat down worse than the warriors beat them last year

if I'm not mistaken, the Pelicans have been up double digits every game against the Warriors this season and only won the one Stephen didn't play in.

This series reminds me of 2011 when the blazers were soundly beaten by the surprise Mavericks who nobody picked to win a championship that year. These Pelicans are for real. Warriors series will be very interesting...

I still can\u2019t believe the Blazers getting beat down by the Pelicans like this, not sure if it\u2019s the Blazers being the normal Blazers underachieving or Pelicans just being better than we thought besides having the best player in the series Anthony Davis lol Lowkey got me thinking

that the Pelicans gon give the Warriors some problems next round the way Rondo and Holiday playing.... Especially with Steph being out even longer. Not saying they\u2019d beat them but they can take em to 6 or maybe 7 without Steph Curry on the court.\n\nWarriors haven\u2019t been impressive

Warriors will be playing the Pelicans the next round without Curry. This will be a very tough series. AD is AD but Jrue Holiday has been playing at a high level on BOTH ends of the floor. He has shut down Damian Lillard. We'll still win that series, but it's going 6.

Can't blame Boogie for the Pelicans not getting worse with how great Davis has been. But at the same time, you can see his flaws that have allowed them to thrive without him. Embiid doesn't have any big flaws like that.

This defensive and ensuing transition 3 is a good example of what the Pels have been successful doing.

Yo ten\u00eda a los Pelicans ganando la serie por el efecto AD, y pens\u00e9 que los gares de NOP pod\u00edan competir contra Lillard y McCollum. Lo que no se ve\u00eda es que Jrue Holiday estuviera jugando mejor de Lillard.

That's just a miserable way of looking at the NBA - \n\nRight now we'd have a chance to beat anyone but Houston or GSW - if we win 53 games that means we'll have a decent shot at winning a playoff series - like the Pelicans are proving that is fun
