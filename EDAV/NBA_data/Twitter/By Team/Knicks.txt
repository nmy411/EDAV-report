I watch every Knicks game beginning to end. After 1st good stretch he had good quarters, which make his box score look nice, but also had large stretches where he was ineffective. Of course the last 2-3 games when they were running 8 guys out there he had to score and assist.

If Jackson was as good an offensive coach as he is defensively, he'd have a coaching job already. Best Knicks fans can hope for with this potential hire is an assistant coach that can preach passing the ball. (Then again, Jackson might not allow that anyway.)

Knicks are willing to make a legit offer considering what he is owed in ATL?
Fri Apr 20 20:09:10 +0000 201
If the Knicks want Bud, I assume they'll pay $8M for 5 years. Lots of cash to take the sting out of MSG

Fri Apr 20 20:10:24 +0000 201
On the Knicks side, it's fairly obvious. My opinion is that Budenholzer is the best coach available. NOT interviewing him (if you're able) would be a bad decision for any team with an opening.
Fri Apr 20 20:10:44 +0000 201
As a former Knicks fan who loves chaos i want them to hire MJax
Fri Apr 20 20:11:16 +0000 201
I tend to agree. With that said, the Knicks are on a (very) short list of teams that might pay him what he's currently making in ATL on an annual basis. That matters. https:\/\/t.co\/gC9Snid6iM

I'd rather coach Milwaukee than NYK too, but the Knicks can offer him a contract that nobody else likely would.
Fri Apr 20 20:17:01 +0000 201
I like that Scott Perry said the Knicks will draft the best talent available oppose to position needs. Many Knick fans will hate that mentality but it's the best mentality.
Fri Apr 20 20:17:51 +0000 201
a good player comparison to Matt Harvey being \u201cKing of NY\u201d who then fell off was Bernard King when he played for the Knicks until he got hurt

Bud also wants to win and win now. Knicks have no depth and have a horrible front office. He is better off staying in atlanta with the 4 picks in the first 34 of the draft this year
Fri Apr 20 20:19:31 +0000 201
if he wants to win now, the Knicks are a better option. You can argue ATL is in better shape long-term perhaps but the Knicks have Porzingis and more on-roster talent.

Knicks don't even know how to tank, they win too much and it hurts their lottery position. New rule should be bottom 4 teams all select by % not weighted what their pick will be. Then next 4 pick the same way. Then all teams pick by %.
Fri Apr 20 20:21:35 +0000 201
As currently constructed, yes Knicks have more talent. But there seems to be more upside after this years draft (assuming they draft well). Knicks still don\u2019t have very good depth outside Porzingas and THJ. Kanter is gone after this year.

The Knicks also have a lottery pick this year that they would probably flip with the Hawks pick. Coach Bud would have that squad in the playoffs next year! Porzingis may be out until January and that New York media is unforgiving.
