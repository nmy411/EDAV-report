Celtics in 5. The group around Giannis IS playing to their max potential which means mediocre is their ceiling. Better pieces need to be put around Giannis as I believe he is a champion minded player. He\u2019s got heart and effort. The rest don\u2019t have it consistently.

But I think the key players were, for the most part. Think of the Lakers, Celtics, Bulls, even the Warriors. The stars on their first championship teams were largely homegrown.
Fri Apr 20 18:37:17 +0000 201

Rodgers would go in a heartbeat if Arsenal came knocking. It\u2019s not even a question. 10 in a row is not a success or an achievement it\u2019s a formality given Celtics finances compared to rest of league. He would have an actual job to do at arsenal on probably quadruple the wages.
