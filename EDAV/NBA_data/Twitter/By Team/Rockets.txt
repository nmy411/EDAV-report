One reason I hate going off a labeled result -- such as WCF appearance in making big decisions. You have to look at the result in context -- they struggled vs Memphis &amp; won a coin flip game 5 vs a meh Rockets team. It's been obvious there's been major flaws on the roster.

All yall calling these Celtics plumbers are ignorant. Just cause they are white doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t ballers. These guys beat the Showtime lakers in the finals, Magic\/Kareem\/Worthy\/Cooper\/McAdoo. Beat the Rockets with Malone &amp; later Olajuwon. Also beat the Pistons in the CF.

[1] Love this defensive possession by the Rockets..

[2] on the wing.. the Rockets then give up a middle drive and kick but Green does a good job contesting the corner 3 on the weakside.. Lastly, Johnson comes all the way from the wing and gets a body on Dieng when the shot goes up and the Rockets end the possession with a rebound

So, last year, Houston Astros already won the 2017 World Series Champions for their 1st title of their franchise history for the Hurricane Harvey at Texas. Well, this year, the Houston Rockets are go all the way up the 2018 NBA Finals, that's my philosophy.

KAT vs the Rockets in the regular season: 22p 16r, 35p 12r, 18p 13r, 20p 18r. He torched the Rockets in the regular season. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s all on the Rockets defense for his terrible play in the playoffs but it\u2019s a big reason. They deserve more credit than being given rn.

Somewhat. I agree he needs post touches especially with the mismatches the Rockets are giving him. But, he was the 2nd most efficient scorer in the regular season with just 4 post ups per game. They can't understand a big being more comfortable off the block

Also, the Rockets won 22 games in a row in that season and by the end of it were only in first place by one or two games. Playing .500 ball for 10 games after your starting center got injured would drop you from 1st to 4th.

Eh I beg to differ. I think it\u2019s all scheme and coaching. Obviously those guys good players but it\u2019s all one on one ball. Hard to win that way. Look at Rockets. Played 3 ball for past 3 years couldn\u2019t win. Then you get cp3 and it changes

Fair take. KD's ankle should be fine, nothing major. Curry set to be re-evaluated today. Rockets probably the biggest contenders in the Western Conf. Don't sleep on the Raptors in the east. I actually think they might make the conference finals.

The Houston Rockets provided another example of the value of the \"hit ahead pass\" with a pass to the top player on the two side. This lead to a space advantage for Chris Paul to pass or drive (he drove). More on the 2 Side Fast Break here https:\/\/t.co\/mWNAv5CX2h https:\/\/t.co\/LTixHVqKa8

One reason I hate going off a labeled result -- such as WCF appearance in making big decisions. You have to look at the result in context -- they struggled vs Memphis &amp; won a coin flip game 5 vs a meh Rockets team. It's been obvious there's been major flaws on the roster.

: Embid back that means Rockets vs 76ers finals. Rockets in 5.

Honestly, I think the could use a Sixers-Rockets finals as opposed to another Warriors-Cavs series.

You're absolutely right about the Rockets cap situation, but the owner says he's willing to pay the luxury tax bill for a contending team &amp; the Rockets were almost unbeatable in the games Harden, Paul &amp; Capela played together during the regular season.

Space X has developed reusable rockets which dramatically saves manufacturing resources. Rockets require rocket fuel. No choice. Automakers have a choice but refuse to use it.

Rockets go up and down all the time right but they just don't put a camera in the window or something? A camera so we can actually watch it go away from the earth? They don't want to see these things themselves? Nasa is not interested in this?
