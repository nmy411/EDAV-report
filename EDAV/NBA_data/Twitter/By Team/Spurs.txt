He gets no credit b\/c people think he played against ass teams in the playoffs while he played the 07 Spurs, the 2000s pistons, 08 Celtics, 09 magic, the 2011 thunder and 2012 spurs. He was playing the wizards with agent 0 in the 1st round. Not a cake walk like ppl think

The divide is between the Spurs franchise and Kawhi, mostly attributed to a very serious, career altering injury sustained in the playoffs last year. Coach Pop just wants his star player to return, and he\u2019s maybe the only person who can get through to Kawhi out of the entire org.

Agreed. Feels like 1-2 young players + 1st rd pick has been the going rate for star players over the past year. Kuzma and Ingram probably have higher ceilings than any other young player sans Oladipo. Would be a great talent reset for the Spurs too.

Life Lesson: Dream of what you want to do. Get close to those who have achieved the most. Learn and then impress. In 1987, Pomona-Pitzer coach Gregg Popovich went to Kansas to get tips from Larry Brown. When Brown went to Spurs, he gave Pop an assistant job. The rest is history. https:\/\/t.co\/oWTPaEP2bi

At the moment, for a managers like Max Allegri, Simeone etc. Spurs are a more exciting project than Arsenal. Not saying Spurs are a historically bigger club, but I reckon top managers would be more interested in taking the Spurs job (if it were available) than the Arsenal one

It could be, there\u2019s a lot missing from that squad at the moment though. Realistically, you\u2019re looking at a need to sign 4 or 5 players for the starting XI, which is a lot. It\u2019ll take time. I think Spurs are more of a safe bet than Arsenal at the moment

It\u2019s a hyperbolic show and I understand they do what they do. Still remember after Dirk beat LeBron in 2011 they ranked Dirk best player in the league and LeBron like 10 (when it was Skip and Stephen A). I also think they ranked ZBo the best PF in the NBA afer 8\/1 Spurs. https:\/\/t.co\/IqxrfEqXS8

Gives him regular Premier League minutes until he hits 19\/20 (birthday is in May), then hopefully Klopp (if still there, which he should be) can then develop him further into a fantastic winger.\n\nRate Sessegnon so highly but don't think he gets into a Liverpool\/Spurs XI just yet.

He tries risky passes which is important, we don't want a risk averse player but against Spurs we are likely going to lose the possession battle and try to play on the break. Rashford has electrifying pace and is more direct than Alexis. Having Martial and Alexis options
