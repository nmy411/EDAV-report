The Warriors have TWO MVPs in their primes, 2 other All-NBA players AND an elite bench. They're guaranteed to win the title every single season. That's why KD &amp; Curry getting hurt would be the absolute best thing that could happen for the league.

yeah, it will be a dogfight either way if Steph is healthy but if Steph misses any games, it will be hard to beat the Pelicans. I'm not saying it's a run-away victory for the Pelicans because who are we kidding the Warriors are still good until somebody can actually beat them 4 X

Los Warriors 3-0 con pinta de 4-0 y sin Curry que vuelve para la segunda ronda. Van 19-1 entre la ultima temporada de playoffs y esta.\nNi los Rockets le podran quitar el campeonato digo yo

Geisinger: The Warriors are obviously nowhere close to being the same monster when they don't have Steph Curry, but it's amazing they can give the keys to the car to a seven-footer and let Kevin Durant run the offense.

San Antonio was 33-8 in the regular season at home, for the most part without Kawhi, with only Toronto and Houston having better records than them at 34-7. GS without Steph beat them handily with their season the line. Warriors can beat anybody, anytime, anyhow. They're That Good

The Warriors will not lose in the second round Stephen A . The Warriors still have enough talent with KD , Green &amp; Thompson . If they are going to be in trouble it will be against the Rockets . All that would mean is that the Warriors will have a smaller margin for error .

I know it's depressing af, but nobody's touching the Warriors. If you think AD and Playoff Rondo is going to take them to the 6 or 7, you are either blinded or delusional. Curry will come back next round no doubt about it.

Sick of hearing about how great Lebron is. I don't think he is not in the top ten players. He is not fit to carry Kevin Durant dirty jock shorts. Cavs will be lucky to win the first round, and will never make it to the finals. Warriors will be champs again.
